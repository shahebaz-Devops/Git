# mkdir github-for-devops-workshop  
# git init                (Create a new Git repository)
# git status              (Check the status of the repository)

Git has three stages of workflow -1. Working aria 2. Staging aria 3. Local Repository.
We send data or code from working aria to staging aria by add command and staging aria to Local repository by 
commit command and finally send data/code from Local repo to central repo by push command.

untracked :- if file is in file system so it is utracked for vcs like git 
staged :- when file is added to staged when code is completed
tracked :- when file is moved from staging to tracked then its tracked for git

# git add <filename>  (Add a file to the staging area:)
# git rm --cached <file>   (to unstaged)
# git add .          (to stage all files at once)
# git commit -m "added testing file" (Commit changes with a message)

now delete the testing.py file and you can also recover it in git

# rm testing.py
# git restore testing.py

If want to send this code to my central repository, I have to connect local repo to central repo first, for this action I 
have to create a new repository (any name) and paste the URL of git repo and execute command as given below 
[Mumbaigit] # git remote add origin https://github.com/zshan227/centralgit2.git

# git remote add origin https://github.com/shahebaz-Devops/git-repository-for-practice.git
# git remote -v (to check we connect or not to github URL)

# git remote set-url origin https://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@github.com/shahebaz-Devops/git-repository-for-practice.git   (to set the url)
# git push origin master
